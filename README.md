## Dev Tools
* [Max MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) is necessary to open the MAX patches which are used as plugins for Ableton.
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is needed to get the necessary drivers and libraries to write and upload code to the Arduinos.

### Libraries
* [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) for LED stripes.
* **OSC:** [CNMAT OSC Library](https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC) for the Arduino, and the *CNMAT Externals* package in Max (can be installed via the package manager).
* [WiFiNINA](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA) to connect with the wifi chip built into the arduino nano 33 iot.
* [ArduinoLSM6DS3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoLSM6DS3) to use the built in gyroscope and accelerometer.
